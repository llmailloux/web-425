        <p>
            James Whitcomb Riley (October 7, 1949 - July 22, 1916)  James was and American writer and poet who was born in Greenfield, IN.  
            He was often called the "Hoosier/Childrens Poet".  His poems were humorous and sentimental.  Two of his most famous poems included “Little Orphant Annie” and “The Raggedy Man”.
            In the late 1890’s Riley was a bestselling author.  His poems were combined into a book that was illustrated by Howard Chandler Christy, and titled Rhymes of Childhood.
             He left a legacy that no one could touch.  The James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis, IN was one of the many memorials dedicated in his name.
